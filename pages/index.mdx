# Ilker Ulusoy

Hey, I'm an experienced Lead iOS Developer who's passionate about creating great mobile apps. 

I'm currently leading the way as a Lead Software Engineer at [VSight](https://www.vsight.io), where I manage iOS and Android teams, help make important technical decisions, and support our talented mobile engineers. 

I'm skilled in technologies like Google Cloud Platform, Firebase, Amazon Web Services, iOS, Swift, Node.js, and REST, and I love finding new ways to make mobile apps awesome.
